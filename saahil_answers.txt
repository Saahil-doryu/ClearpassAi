Q: Let's say you're building a simple to-do list application.  You need to store each task, which includes a description (text) and whether it's completed (true/false).  Describe, in as much detail as you can, how you would represent a single task using a data structure, and explain why you chose that structure.  Feel free to use any programming language you're comfortable with to illustrate your point – even pseudocode is fine.  We're more interested in your thought process and reasoning than perfectly syntactically correct code.
A: i'd use a dictionary with key
F: Incomplete.  The answer needs to specify the keys and their data types (e.g., `"description": string, "completed": boolean`).  It also lacks the explanation of *why* a dictionary is a suitable choice.

Q: Let's say you're building a simple to-do list application.  Imagine you have a list of tasks, each with a description and a completion status (true/false).  Describe, in simple terms, how you would approach designing the data structure to store this information in a program.  What would be the advantages and disadvantages of the structure you choose?  And, if you were to later add a feature allowing users to prioritize tasks (high, medium, low), how would you modify your data structure?
A: Use an array (or list) of Task objects, each having a description string and a boolean completed flag. Advantages: straightforward, order-preserving. Disadvantages: linear search for filters. To add priorities, extend Task with a priority field (enum or string: HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW), enabling sorting or grouping by priority. Memory usage low for lists.
F: Good, clear explanation of a basic approach.  Could mention the inefficiency of searching/filtering a large list and the improved search efficiency of other data structures (like a hash table for searching by description, or a sorted list for priority sorting).


Q: Let's say you're building a simple to-do list application.  You want to store the tasks, their due dates, and whether they're completed.  Describe, in simple terms, how you would represent this data using a structure like a list of dictionaries, or something similar.  Don't worry about coding specifics, just explain the logic and structure you'd use.  Then, tell me how you might access and modify the information within that structure, for example, to mark a task as complete.
A: Use an array (or list) of Task objects, each having a description string and a boolean completed flag. Advantages: straightforward, order-preserving. Disadvantages: linear search for filters. To add priorities, extend Task with a priority field (enum or string: HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW), enabling sorting or grouping by priority. Memory usage low for lists.
F: The answer is incomplete.  It omits due dates and doesn't adequately explain access/modification.  The description of a "Task object" is too vague.  A list of dictionaries would be a more illustrative and simpler example for this prompt's level.


Q: Let's say you're building a simple to-do list application.  Describe, in as much detail as you can, how you would approach designing the data structure to store the to-do items.

You don't need to write code, but explain your reasoning and the trade-offs you'd consider.

Q: Let's say you're building a simple to-do list app.  The user can add tasks, mark them as complete, and delete them.  Describe, in simple terms, how you would approach designing the data structure to store these tasks. What would be the key elements, and why would you choose those elements?  Don't worry about specific programming languages or syntax; I'm more interested in your understanding of data organization and problem-solving.
A: Represent tasks as records with a text description and a done flag, stored in a sequence (like a list). This preserves insertion order and allows easy iteration. Access by index for updates. For priority, add a priority attribute (enum: HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW) to each record, enabling easy sorting or partitioning by importance.
F: Good, clear and concise.  Adding a unique ID to each task would improve robustness.
